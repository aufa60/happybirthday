          <p>Thank you for opening this little website. <img class="sticker" src="${stickers[0]}"></p>
          <p>thank you for being such a great person.
            thank you for always hearing me out.
            thank you for always listening to my stupid and childish stories.
            thank you for being there.
            you mean so much to me, even if it's just virtual. ðŸ’Œ

            honestly, i never thought iâ€™d end up becoming friends with someone through a virtual bot like this.
            even crazier i never expected to meet someone normal here. like, wow... what are the odds?
            but here we are.
            listening to your stories, no matter how random, has been something really new for me â€” in a good way.
            itâ€™s refreshing, comforting, and honestly, kinda exciting.
            youâ€™ve become someone i look forward to talking to.
            i truly enjoy getting to know you. ðŸŒ·
            <p>so again, thank you.
            for being here.
            for being you.ðŸ’Œ 
            <p>hope everything goes smoothly for you.
            may your days be filled with peace, clarity, and purpose.
            whatever youâ€™re working on whether itâ€™s something big or small i hope it brings you closer to the version of yourself you want to be.
            i pray that you stay healthy, happy, and surrounded by good energy.
            even when things get tough, may you always find the strength to keep going.
            you deserve ease, you deserve growth, and you deserve moments that make your heart feel full.<img class="sticker" src="${stickers[1]}"></p>
